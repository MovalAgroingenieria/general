        This module add street type field to the partner address fields. The street type is shown before the
        street field in views and printable documents. How the street type field is shown (full street type
        name [default], abbreviation or not shown) is set in "Settings > Street Type Management > Settings".
        <br>
        To display the street type in the direction of the printable documents, the variable address_format
        will be modified by adding the field before the street field and will be apply to all countries. This
        order can be changed in street type settings (affecting all countries) or for each country in
        "Sales > Configuration > Contacta > Localization > Countries". If you want to avoid this address reformatting
        delete the hook 'post_init_hook' in the manifest.
        <br>
        <b>The types of street and their abbreviations are dependent on each country, so this is a base module
        that introduces the model and the views, the data must be provided by another module or has to be imported.</b>
