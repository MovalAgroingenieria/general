Maintenance Stock
=================

.. note::
   Backport migration of original module Maintenance Stock of version 12.0


Usage
=====

Once installed, first you should enable consumptions for a certain equipment
and filling a default warehouse for the picking operations:

   :width: 600 px

Then, for every mainteance request of this equipment, *Picking List* button
allows us to make consumptions, that will be picking documents with their own
sequence:

By default, the origin location for this operations will be the stock location
for the default warehouse, and destination a new *Consumptions* location, that
will not compute for stock inventory, like e.g. partner locations:

From both request and equipment forms these stock operations and *Product Moves*
are available.

Return operations are also enabled, and will be linked to the request and
equipment as well:

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* Product standard list. Enable defining product standard lists (at least,
  product and quantity per line), and link them with equipments. Then, every
  maintenance request could select one of them and automatically fill the
  product and quantity list.
