        This module add to the "Partner Addresss Street Type" module the Spanish street types and
        their abbreviations according to the `Spanish cadastre <http://www.catastro.meh.es>`_. These
        types of street are accepted by most Spanish public entities, such as the Treasury or the
        National Statistics Institute (INE).
        <br>
        The Spanish cadastre accepts other languages besides the Castilian, which increases the list
        to more than 300 street types, so only some of them have been marked to appear on the list by
        default. The type of streets shown can be configured in /Settings/Street Type Management/Street
        types.
